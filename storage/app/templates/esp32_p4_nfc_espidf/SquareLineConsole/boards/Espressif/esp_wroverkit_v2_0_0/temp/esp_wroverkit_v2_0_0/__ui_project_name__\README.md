ESP Wrover-kit board-template for SquareLine Studio

You can build with `build.sh`/`build.bat` if ESP-IDF is installed on your operating system, and flash to the device with `flash.sh` and `flash.bat` scripts.
(If you want to use the .bat scripts, it might be necessary to modify the version in them to that of the installed ESP-IDF.)

LVGL now doesn't handle 16bit color high/low-byte (endianness) swapping in the pixel-drawing routines, but the driver's flush routine can do it by a function before sending out the pixels of an area.
Therefore the '16bit swap' LVGL setting is not relevant anymore for LVGL9.1 (and in SquareLine Studio projects) and the driver needs to take care of the swapping implicitly when the display requires that.
That's why '16' replaces '16 swap' in the board-templates starting with LVGL9.1.

Currently SquareLine Studio doesn't set `sdkconfig` or `sdkconfig.defaults` in the exported ESP-IDF project according to changes in required `montserrat` fonts or drive-assets.
So you need to use `idf.py menuconfig` (Components/LVGL menu) or comment out any (other than size-14) `montserrat` font manually in `sdkconfig` (or `sdkconfig.defaults` with deletion of `sdkconfig`) that is required by your project.


# ESP Generated SquareLine Example

This example is generated by SquareLine. It can show the UI generated by SquareLine on the display. More information is on [BSP GitHub](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp).

### Compile and flash

```
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor
```
